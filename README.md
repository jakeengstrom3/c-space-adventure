<h1>C Space Adventures!</h1>
<h2>A CS 201 final Project</h2>

<p1>A relativly simple C program that allows the user to explore the solar system. It uses the json-c library to parse a json file containing all the planetary info. Either choose a planet to 'visit' , or have the program randomly select a planet to visit, and the program will display a fact about that planet.</p1>
