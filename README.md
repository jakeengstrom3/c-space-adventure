<h1>C Space Adventures!</h1>
<h2>The CS 201 final Project written in C</h2>

<p1>A relativly simple C program that allows the user to explore the solar system. It uses the json-c library to parse a json file containing all the planetary info. Either choose a planet to 'visit' , or have the program randomly select a planet, and you will be presented with a fun fact about that planet. To begin, simply run the run.sh shell script. </p1>
